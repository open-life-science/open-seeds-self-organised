# About OLS

*Welcome to the OLS's Open Seeds program training materials.*

OLS (Open Life Science) is a non-profit organisation that is committed to fostering capacity building and promoting diverse leadership through open science. We aim to create a future where research is accessible, inclusive, and equitable.

## Open Seeds for Self-Paced and Group Learning

Our flagship project is Open Seeds, a 16-week cohort-based program tailored for individuals and teams passionate about integrating open principles into their work. This program helps learners gain the skills to design, lead, and sustain impactful projects while identifying and connecting with diverse actors in an open science community.

From 2020 to 2024, we have delivered 11 cohorts of open science training, our structured mentorship and training program. Through these several rounds of training, we have developed and curated numerous talks and resources with contributions from hundreds of open science experts and practitioners. We are happy to share these with you in a format that can allow you to follow Open Seeds’ training in a self-paced manner, or share this program with your community using pre-recorded presentations.

### Who is this resource for?

Whether you’re new to open science or an experienced practitioner, Open Seeds will inspire you to become an Open Science ambassador in your community. We hope this learning resource will offer open science skills and help you take steps toward making your research more open, reproducible and reusable for yourself and your community.
