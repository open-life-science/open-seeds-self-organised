# Week 03
This week is for you to catch up on the various concepts you learned over the last two weeks. Also, this is a perfect opportunity to meet your mentor or accountability buddy to discuss your progress and ask any questions related to the training plans and assignments. In the absence of a mentor or accountability buddy, please make sure to do your self-progress check-in.
