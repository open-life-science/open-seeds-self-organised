# Week 03 Training Plan

This week is for you to catch up on the various concepts you learned over the last two weeks. Also, this is a perfect opportunity to meet your mentor or accountability buddy to discuss your progress and ask any questions about the training plans and assignments.

In the absence of a mentor or accountability buddy, please make sure you can do your self-progress check-in:
- Review training plans from the previous weeks and reflect on your learning so far!
- Review assignments you have developed for your personal work - identify where you have some gaps to fill
- You can review notes and assignments from some of our previous cohort members shared on OLS's GitHub repos for (Open Seeds [OLS-1](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-1/issues), [OLS-2](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-2/issues), [OLS-3](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-3/issues) and so on until [OLS-9](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-9/issues).

Happy learning!
