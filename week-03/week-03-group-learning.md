# Week 03 Group-Based Learning Notes

This week provides an opportunity for both self-directed learning and connecting with your mentor or accountability buddy to reflect on your learning journey.

Use this time to:

* **Review** the resources introduced in previous weeks.
* **Reflect** on the assignments and documentation you've started working on.
* **Draw inspiration** from other Open Seeds projects.

To facilitate this self-reflection process, here's a checklist:

* Review training plans from previous weeks and reflect on your learning progress so far.
* Review the assignments you have developed for your personal work â€“ identify areas where you need to fill in gaps.
* Explore notes and assignments from previous cohort members shared on OLS's GitHub repositories for Open Seeds:
    * [OLS-1](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-1/issues)
    * [OLS-2](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-2/issues)
    * [OLS-3](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-3/issues)
    * ...and so on, up to [OLS-9](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-9/issues).
* Reach out to the program organiser if any part of the program is unclear to you.
* Engage with your peers by exchanging assignments, inviting or sharing feedback, and getting to know each other.
* If you are meeting with your mentor or accountability buddy, bring your assignments and discuss them, focusing particularly on your progress and areas where you need their feedback.

Happy learning!
