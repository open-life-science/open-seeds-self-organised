# Week 03 Self-Paced Learning Notes

This week offers an opportunity for self-directed learning. Use this time to:

* **Review** the resources introduced in the previous weeks.
* **Reflect** on the assignments and documentation you've begun working on.
* **Draw inspiration** from other Open Seeds projects.

To facilitate this self-reflection process, here's a checklist:

* Review training plans from the previous weeks and reflect on your learning so far!
* Review assignments you have developed for your personal work - identify where you have some gaps to fill
* You can review notes and assignments from some of our previous cohort members shared on OLS's GitHub repos for (Open Seeds [OLS-1](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-1/issues), [OLS-2](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-2/issues), [OLS-3](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-3/issues) and so on until [OLS-9](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-9/issues).

Happy learning!
