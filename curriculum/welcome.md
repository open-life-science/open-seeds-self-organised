We are excited to be part of this lifelong learning process!

## Here's What You Can Expect

- Weekly learning plan for following these topics an organised group or self-paced learning.
- Recordings from previous Open Seeds training cohort, exposing you to practical examples from diverse contexts.
- Templates to take notes as you follow along the learning plan with opportunities for self-reflection individually and discussions for group-based learning.
- Practical assignments with guided frameworks to apply learned topics and gain hands-on experience in implementing open practices in your projects and initiatives.

### Self-Paced Learning

Although  Open Seeds has been centrally organised by OLS and offered as cohort-based format, you can explore our comprehensive modules at your own pace, fitting them into your schedule.

### Mentoring opportunities

Open Seeds, when organised by OLS comes with 1:1 mentor:mentee or mentor:mentee group opportunity.
Mentors work closely with participants to help further their Open Science skills and become ambassadors for Open Science practice, training and education in their communities. The mentors will be assigned to one or more projects (based on their availability) proposed in the program.

When following with training material on your own or as part of a group, we recommend you to reach out to experienced mentors who can provide guidance and support as you navigate your open journey.

You can look up our previous speakers and cohort members as good starting point.

We encourage you to dive in, explore the resources, and reach out to the OLS team for any support.

*We're excited to see the seeds of open collaboration you'll plant.*

Happy learning!
