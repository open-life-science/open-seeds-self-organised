## Group-based Learning organised by 'Trainers' or Organisers

* *Irene* found Open Seeds materials on the OLS website and started using this library for her work. She will organise training for people in her research lab but wants to include examples used in the programme for something more relevant to her research. She decided to invite mentors from her research field to support learners. She also plans to host panel discussions with these mentors.

* *Taj* wants to deliver Open Seeds for the new cohort but doesn’t have sufficient time or funding to identify mentors. He wants to use the materials for training but wants to ensure that the training quality is not affected by the mentors. He uses the organiser's handbook for the training delivery plan and instead of mentor-mentee meetings, he organises an open discussion call after each week of training so the learners have the opportunity to ask questions.

* Open Seeds team has provided extensive set of resources to help her plan the training that will be helpful for Irene to prepare. Some of the things that Irene and Taj might be concerned about are their capacity and timeline to deliver this training. They use the organisers' handbook to plan their training schedule.

## Individual learner for self-paced learning

* *Seun* finds these materials and wants to use them for self-paced learning. He has just started a project where he thinks Open Seeds will help him. He is unsure if he has 16 weeks to commit, but he came up with a plan to review training materials in 1 month or that he will take longer than 16 weeks. He uses the 16-week plan to block his calendar where he will catch up with training materials (1.5-2 hours per session).

* Open Seeds team have provided materials for mentor-mentee meetings. While an individual learner can decide to not have a mentor, we highly recommend that they identify someone who has experience working in open science or a peer as an “accountability buddy” who they meet every second week (read why we recommend having a mentor or accountability buddy in Open Seeds). In the absence of a mentor or peer, they can use the document provided for progress check-in after each learning session.
