# OLS - Open Seeds Curriculum

*The [OLS team](https://we-are-ols.org/) welcomes you to the Open Seeds program training materials for self-paced and group learning.*

The [Open Seeds program](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/) by OLS is for people interested in applying open principles in their work and becoming Open Science ambassadors in their communities.

We are delighted you' are here, joining a long list of individuals and communities passionate about open science, leadership, and collaborative learning.

These resources are designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills to cultivate open practices in your work, regardless of your experience level.

## Here's What You Can Expect

- **Comprehensive Curriculum**: Explore key open science, reproducibility, and collaborative research topics with a structured learning path.
- **Flexible Learning**: Follow a weekly plan, adaptable for group or self-paced study.
- **Real-World Insights**: Access recordings from previous Open Seeds cohorts, showcasing diverse practical applications shared in short talks from our [expert community](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/about.html#experts).
- **Guided Reflection/Discussion**: Utilise note-taking templates and prompts for individual reflection and collaborative group discussions.
- **Practical Application**: Apply your knowledge through guided assignments, gaining hands-on experience in implementing open practices.

### Self-Paced Learning

While Open Seeds is traditionally offered as a cohort-based program by OLS, you can access our comprehensive modules and learn at your own pace, fitting them seamlessly into your schedule.

### Mentoring Process

When participating in an OLS-organised Open Seeds cohort, you'll benefit from dedicated mentoring, with 1:1 or group sessions.
Mentors collaborate closely with participants, fostering their open science skills and empowering them to become advocates for open science practices, training, and education within their communities. 
Mentors are assigned to projects based on their domain expertise and availability.

If you're exploring the training material independently or as part of a self-organised group, we strongly encourage you to seek out experienced mentors who can offer valuable guidance and support along your open science journey.
Our previous speakers and cohort members are excellent starting points for finding potential mentors.

We invite you to explore the Open Seeds resources, read and use the materials, and don't hesitate to contact the OLS team for any assistance you may need.

*We're excited to see the seeds of open collaboration you'll plant.*

Happy learning!
