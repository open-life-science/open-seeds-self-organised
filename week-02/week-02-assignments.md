# Week 02 Assignments

After you have completed the training plan for week 02, start creating these resources for your project:

## 1. Self-reflection and documentation: Open Canvas for your project!

* [Template, instruction and example](https://zenodo.org/records/14268572/files/%5BMAKE%20A%20COPY%5D%20%5BOLS-9%5D%20Week%2002%20-%20Open%20Canvas%20-%20Template.pptx?download=1%20) (make a personal copy) 

 **Notes on Open Canvas**

* You can fill in your open canvas in the language that you're most comfortable with - no need to write on it in English!
* The Canvas helps people to think more clearly on their projects
* You can revisit your canvas as you go, and you can have different versions each time you modify it
* We often realise that the original scope of our project is too broad, and we missed a step before what we thought would be the main goal. It's ok to reshape your project after going through the open canvas!
* The key metrics can be a challenge to define, as they are very tightly related to your definition of success. Make sure to discuss that with your mentors

## 2. Value Exchanges: Compare and Contrast

* Complete this compare and contrast assignment about current and desired community interactions and value exchanges: [Template Link](https://zenodo.org/records/14268572/files/%5BMAKE%20A%20COPY%5D%20Week%2002%20-%20Compare%26Contrast.docx?download=1%20) (make a personal copy)

## 3. Roadmap for your project

* Start your Roadmap draft: [Template Link](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/) (make a personal copy)
* Your roadmap should reflect smaller milestones indicating progress towards your big idea

**Identify:**

* Based on your vision, what are some  short-term goals? What do you need to do to get there?
* How would you know that you are making progress towards your goals? What are some milestones?
