Quote of the week: ‚ÄúDesign must be an innovative, highly creative, cross-disciplinary tool responsive to the needs of men. It must be more research-oriented, and we must stop defiling the earth itself with poorly-designed objects and structures.‚Äù
‚Äï Victor Papanek, Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change
