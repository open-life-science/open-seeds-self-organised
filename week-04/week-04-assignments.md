# Assignments after you have completed the learning plan for week 04:

1. Draft your README file and store it in your project folder  
2. Select an open license for your project, and draft a file called LICENSE with text from the selected license (if already using GitHub, this will be LICENSE.md). Here are some guidance:  
   1. Open documentation or creative outputs: you can select the Creative Commons license: [https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/)   
   2. Open code/software: use the recommender: [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)   
   3. Open data: find recommendations for research data license by F1000: [https://www.f1000.com/researcher\_blog/open-licenses-data/](https://www.f1000.com/researcher_blog/open-licenses-data/)    
3. **Optional \- deep dive**: Identify different kinds of research outputs you would like to share from your project, find a comprehensive list in Opensciency Project: [https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/open-results/lesson1-research-process-and-results.html\#what-research-objects-are-commonly-associated-with-research-stages](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/open-results/lesson1-research-process-and-results.html#what-research-objects-are-commonly-associated-with-research-stages)   
4. Assess if you are confident about your license choices, or if you have to consider a different kind of license for your project  
   1. For projects producing multiple kinds of outputs, the same LICENSE file can have details about the selected file (see example in the template repo: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/reproducible-project-template/blob/main/LICENSE.md](https://github.com/the-turing-way/reproducible-project-template/blob/main/LICENSE.md)))   
5. Draft a Code of Conduct for your project in a file called CODE OF CONDUCT (in GitHub this will be a .md file)  
   1. Find guidance: [https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-a-code-of-conduct/](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-a-code-of-conduct/)   
   2. You can use this template: [https://github.com/the-turing-way/reproducible-project-template/blob/main/CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/the-turing-way/reproducible-project-template/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)   
   3. You can also explore open projects (such as in OLS, Turing Way, Carpentries etc.) and select/adapt a CoC that suits the needs of your project  
6. Look up example projects in the issues from previous cohorts:  
   1. OLS-9: https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-9/issues  
   2. OLS-8: https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-8/issues  
   3. OLS-7: https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-7/issues
